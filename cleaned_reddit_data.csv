Unrealized losses in the US banking system are once again on the rise, according to new numbers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

In its Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC [says](https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024) banks are now saddled with more than half a trillion dollars in paper losses on their balance sheets, due largely to exposure to the residential real estate market.

Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets.

Although banks can hold securities until they mature without marking them to market on their balance sheets, unrealized losses can become an extreme liability when banks need liquidity.

*“Unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities increased by $39 billion to $517 billion in the first quarter. Higher unrealized losses on residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting from higher mortgage rates in the first quarter, drove the overall increase. This is the ninth straight quarter of unusually high unrealized losses since the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in first quarter 2022.”* 

The FDIC also says that the number of lenders on its Problem Bank List rose last quarter. According to the agency, these banks are on the brink of insolvency due to financial, operational, or managerial weakness or a combination of such issues.

*“The number of banks on the Problem Bank List, those with a CAMELS composite rating of ‘4’ or ‘5’ increased from* ***52 in fourth quarter 2023 to 63 in first quarter 2024****. The number of problem banks represented 1.4% of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1% to 2% of all banks.*  ***Total assets held by problem banks increased $15.8 billion to $82.1 billion during the quarter.”*** 

While the FDIC says that the health of the US banking system is **at no imminent risk**, it warns that persistent inflation, volatile market rates and geopolitical concerns continue to put pressure on the industry.

*“These issues could cause credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, deterioration in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties and credit card loans, continues to warrant monitoring. These issues, together with funding and margin pressures, will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.”* "

2024-06-05 19:11:27,nvidia briefly passes 3 trillion market cap on back of ai boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia’s milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.

""TSMC's wafer price is indeed too low,"" said Huang at a Computex investor luncheon in Taipei on Wednesday.""I think TSMC's \[service\] price is too low,"" and that ""TSMC’s contribution to the world and the tech industry is under-presented by its financial results,"" he added.""NVIDIA is TSMC’s key customer and accounts for 10% of TSMC’s 2024 revenue, we estimate,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan and others in a note. ""We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow.""

""We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,"" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand.

Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).""We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,"" Chan noted. ""No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.""Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock. Its price is up 55% year to date."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-06-09 15:11:21,bear case why i believe alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA."

2024-06-09 23:18:01,apples aapl rollercoaster should you jump in now,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it’s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

Apple makes AI capabilities available and  attractive a way that Microsoft, google, and fail to do so as well.   I think it's going to add a lot of Apple over the next couple years, especially as they continue to add features.  Smart to make privacy a priority from the beginning. 

As it will take a while to implement, and apple is under DOJ scrutiny, and people underestimate apple, it'll be a while til it's reflected in share price, but  this implementation I think will pay off long term.  

Until then, some buying opportunities, I'd wager."

2024-06-11 02:29:03,riding the msft rocket ,"Riding the MSFT Rocket 🚀 

Alright, here’s 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume’s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their “buy” rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it “overweight,” targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a “buy.” 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a “buy,” with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft’s advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsoft’s financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsoft’s robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**There’s been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft’s future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They’ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They’ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft’s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications’ performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure’s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft’s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apple’s Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it’s got people rethinking their game plan. Here’s the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, “Seriously, Apple? That’s it?”
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn’t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren’t having it. Apple’s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say “AI fail.” Wall Street’s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn’t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they’re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple’s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT’s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: I’m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it’s a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: I’m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: I’m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays’ more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: I’ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: I’ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsoft’s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. I’ll stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade. 

Here’s to making smart moves! 🥂

2024-06-11 15:25:40,affirm buy now pay later loans will be embedded into apple pay ,"Apple device users will soon be able to tap into buy now, pay later loans from Affirm for purchases, the companies said Tuesday.

Affirm will surface as an option for U.S. Apple Pay users on iPhones and iPads later this year, the San Francisco-based fintech company said in a filing. Apple confirmed the news in its own update.

“This provides users with additional payment choices, and offers the ease, convenience and security of Apple Pay alongside the features users love in Affirm – flexibility, transparency and no late or hidden fees,” Affirm said in an email statement.

The move is a boost to Affirm and the buy now, pay later sector in general. When Apple introduced its own BNPL product last year, investors were concerned that the tech giant would crowd out standalone providers like Affirm. But the fact that Apple decided to also allow Affirm products in its ecosystem shows that the fintech company has something unique to offer.

For instance, while Apple’s BNPL loan lets users repay purchases in four installments over six weeks, Affirm has an array of longer-term offerings that can be repaid over a year or more. The companies didn’t provide details on the terms of the new loans.

“The bottom-line — in our view — is that Affirm’s strong brand and sophisticated underwriting technology have a moat that Apple likely could not replicate on its own,” Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev said in a research note.

Citi, Synchrony

Apple also said that installment loans via credit and debit cards would be available on Apple Pay in the U.S. with Citigroup, Synchrony and Fiserv-related issuers. Traditional credit-card players have begun offering BNPL-style installment loans after their popularity surged during the Covid pandemic.

Thanks to the ubiquity of the iPhone, Apple Pay has more than 500 million users around the world and a leading market share in the U.S. for its mobile payment and digital wallet platform.

Shares of Affirm rose 5% in early trading Tuesday, while shares of Apple were up about 5.3%.

Affirm’s stock rose despite the fact that the company indicated it would take time for the partnership to significantly boost its revenue.

“Affirm does not expect this partnership to have a material impact on revenue or gross merchandise volume in fiscal year 2025,” the company said in its filing.

Since the pullback in April, it has been up 40% since.

However, the company is way overvalued based on P/S, P/E and forward P/E. The company hasn’t proved itself yet, and for me is just riding the Nvidia wave.

Apple held the conference yesterday + analysts upgraded the stock, and yet it’s only up 6% today. Why is Arm up 5% today? The price now sitting at 145 is also way way way up from consensus price.

2024-06-14 02:22:54,musk says robots could make tesla 25 trillion company  more than half value of sp 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.

Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.

“I’m a helpful accelerant to that future,” he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.

He said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.

“What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,” Musk said.

2024-06-14 02:22:54,musk says robots could make tesla 25 trillion company  more than half value of sp 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Before you downvote, no I don’t mean what are you buying 1 week calls on. 

I mean outside of ETF’s and mutual funds, do you have a particular stock that over the next 5-10 years you are hyper bullish on, believing it’s the next “big thing”. 

No, this isn’t me lazily asking Redditors to do DD for me. 90% of my account is invested in ETF’s with the remaining 10% in one stock that I plan to hold until at least 2030. (No I won’t say it here, I don’t want this to sound like a thinly veiled plug and no it’s not *that* stock). 

Im curious if there’s any of you like me with a similar conviction for a company.

2024-06-17 17:15:52,nvidia to get 20 weighting and billions in investor demand while apple demoted in major tech fund,"KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

2024-06-17 23:38:18,tsla might be the most undervalued ai play in the stock market ,"Elon musk, love him or hate him but he's been preaching AI long before anyone in silicon valley even cared.   Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

Lastly the debate is over, Telsa is a Tech company, its a conglomerate like GE once was."
2024-06-18 03:35:38,apple stops offering buy now pay later loans in us  ,"Apple said on Monday that it has stopped issuing loans through Apple Pay Later, its buy-now-pay-later program that launched last year.

The move comes after Apple said it would start allowing installment loans later this year in its Apple Pay checkout process through third-party companies, such as Affirm, and credit and debit cards from issuers, such as Citigroup.

Apple said it would no longer issue Apple Pay Later loans, which enabled customers to buy products online and pay in four interest-free installments, at prices up to $1,000. The discontinuation is a sign that not every new fintech feature or product that Apple launches becomes a success or fits in with the iPhone maker’s overall strategy.

“Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.”

Apple said users who wanted installment plans at checkout would gain access to them through other financial intermediaries in more countries around the world than they would with Apple Pay Later, which was only available in the U.S.

Apple said its priority with Apple Pay, the brand name for its contactless and online payment software, was to enable secure and private payments. Users with open loans will continue to have access to Apple Pay Later features to manage and pay their loans, Apple said.

Before it was discontinued, Apple Pay Later enabled users to apply for loans within the iPhone Wallet app, and approved users would see a “Pay Later” option when checking out online.

The process notably involved Apple taking over more of the financial backend than some of its other products, like Apple Card. For the program, Apple made some of its own credit credit checks and loan decisions, instead of having those handled entirely through financial partners. Apple’s loans were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary.

2024-06-18 17:07:58,nvidia passes microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.

I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-06-22 17:12:40,apple intelligence wont launch in eu in 2024 due to antitrust rules company says ,"Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.

Apple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”

2024-06-24 11:03:10,european union regulators accuse apple of breaching the blocs tech rules ,"European Union regulators on Monday said that Apple is in breach of sweeping new tech rules because it does not allow customers of its App Store to be steered to alternatives.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, also said it had opened a new probe into Apple into new contractual terms with developers.

The EU opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to reel in the power of Big Tech firms. So-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

On Monday, regulators said in their preliminary findings that Apple was in breach of the DMA because its App Store rules “prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.”

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Apple only allows steering through a system where app developers can provide a link that sends users to a webpage where they can then purchase content, such as a subscription, according to the Commission. However, this process is “subject to several restrictions imposed by Apple that prevent app developers from communicating, promoting offers and concluding contracts through the distribution channel of their choice,” the Commission noted.

The regulators also said that the fees Apple charges developers for the initial acquisition of new customers via the App Store “go beyond what is strictly necessary.” The Commission did not disclose what represents a “strictly necessary” fee.

Apple could face fines of up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover, if it is found in breach of the DMA.

The U.S. tech giant has been in EU’s crosshairs this year. Regulators hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.93 billion) antitrust fine in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. The steering rules were also a focus in that investigation.

EU opens another DMA probe

Apple made some big changes to its App Store in the EU this year in anticipation of the DMA. The Cupertino giant now allows apps to be downloaded from websites, as well as third-party app stores on its devices.

But the Commission also raised concerns about some of Apple’s new practices.

Apple still charges a “core technology fee” of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per app installed for downloads outside its own App Store. The Commission said it is looking into whether this complies with the DMA.

Regulators are also looking at whether the steps Apple makes users take to download alternative app stores or apps comply with the bloc’s rules.

The Commission will also look at whether “eligibility requirements related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones” is also in compliance with the tech law.

Shares rose as much as 3.6% Wednesday to $193.04, pushing the market value to more than $2 trillion. The company is now a member of an elite club of a handful of peers that have surpassed the key market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. passed the $2 trillion threshold in late April, while rallies have pushed market values of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to more than $3 trillion. 

Amazon shares have whipsawed since the company’s first quarter earnings, when the cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, helping to power the stock back above the all-time high set in April. The stock rallied in June, recovering losses from the end of May to gain about 27% so far this year.

Shares of the megacap technology company have gotten a lift over the past year as the company cut costs and restructured its business to better take advantage of the AI frenzy. In addition, its key Amazon Web Services business has shown signs of re-accelerating growth, a major point of optimism for investors. "

2024-06-28 03:52:09,hedge funds sell tech stocks aggressively goldman says,"In a month when Nvidia Corp. briefly became the world’s largest company, hedge funds were “aggressively” selling tech stocks, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

This month’s net selling in the US tech sector is on track to be the largest on record going back in data since 2017, according to Goldman’s prime brokerage data. Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by software and internet stocks.

Nvidia shares have been choppy after losing $430 billion in market value late last week. And, June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteoric rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. accounted for well over half of the 15% advance in the S&P 500 this year.

The trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&P 500 hit 33% last week, the highest level in about 24 years.

What’s more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds’ momentum exposure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Goldman data showed. “Long concentration” and “long crowdedness” have both seen notable declines and are at the lowest levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a potential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.

The unwind is not just hitting tech alone. Hedge funds are now tilting more defensively than usual. Their gross leverage — a measure of risk appetite — has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold regions so far in June.

“After adding risk to their portfolio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk unwinds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers,” Goldman wrote in a note.

2024-06-30 16:41:51,thoughts on nintendo ntdoy,"I don’t see it talked about very frequently (probably because it’s listed in Japan) 

From what I’ve researched many people stay away since Japan’s stock market is terrible and has been stagnant for 30 years. This could eventually change though, maybe not anytime soon since Japanese economics are complicated. 

They are positioned very favorable in the gaming landscape especially compared to Xbox and Sony at the moment. If they don’t fuck it up with the next system in 2025 then they’ll likely be golden. 

I’m more curious about them expanding out into other entertainment ventures, such as, theme parks, movies, etc. owning 1/3 of Pokemon is also quite lucrative. It just appears like the stock never moves.

I own a small position and would like to keep adding to it as I’m also a huge fan of the company but, some of the factors are tilting me away from wanting to add more to the position. 

What does everyone else think? I’d like to hear about other companies other than Nvidia and Apple all the time.

Won't it be more profitable to invest in solely the top companies? Or is that more of a short term thing. Thanks in advance."
2024-07-01 20:08:10,what do you guys think about being exposed in one stock,"I used to have a broad portfolio slowly trimming down the winners for the stock that was going down at the time now I find myself totally exposed in one stock,no that I am worried about the future of the company I’m exposed as I believe in the company I sold stocks like Apple,meta,Microsoft,Sony(many others) to give you an idea.

The investment is doing really well,I’d like to know what are your thoughts on this and if there are other people like me out there."
2024-07-02 15:04:13,only interrupt compounding unless its absolutely necessary,"So I hope you are all doing fine with your portfolios. I checked my YTD performance due to mid-year. I am up 21% (30th June) vs the S&P's about 14%. I just realized something I never really thought of before, because I was not a huge seller so far. My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.

I am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000€(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says “If you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.” The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.

Take for example AAPL. €10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% €11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: €1.7k gains 26% taxed left about €11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding. I mean this is no rocket science and I am dumb to realize this only now, but the recent tax hits really opened my eyes.

To end this post with something useful: How is your portfolio doing? Have you beaten the S&P? What's your % YTD?

TLDR: Tax on my investments is destroys my gains. Never interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

>In short, the E.U. either has or is about to cross a critical line in terms of overplaying its hand: yes, most of tech may have been annoyed by their regulations, but the economic value of having one code base for the entire world meant that everyone put up with it (including users outside of the E.U.); once that code base splits, though — as it recently did for Apple — the calculations of whether or not to even serve E.U. users becomes that much closer; dramatically increasing potential fines far beyond what the region is worth only exacerbates the issue."

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much.

The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best.

2024-07-11 05:11:29,what truly affects the prices of sp500 etfs,"This is a genuine question out of curiosity (no practicality involved). VOO/VTI/SPY (just to name a few) tracks the movement of S&P500. It’s been long known that the ETFs move in direct synergy with the index itself. 

I noticed VOO has level 2 market data on Moomoo showing the bid & ask. So it seems on first glance that people trading the ETF affects the price of the ETF itself. Meaning, more people buying VOO than selling = price increase and vice versa, rather than based on the prices of the 500 companies. But this can’t be true, since it moves in perfect synergy (minus management costs) with the S&P500 index itself. 

Does the price of VOO gets affected by:

1) All the cumulative movements of the 500 companies it tracks based on weightage? Ppl trading on the ETF has no direct effect on its price.

2) The supply & demand of the ETF itself (behaving just like any other stock). The tracked companies market cap increasing have no direct effect on its price. 

3) Or because buying VOO theoretically means you’re buying all 500 companies, so both 1) and 2) are true at the same time?

Which statement above is correct? Would appreciate if someone can shed some insight!


PS: if my assumption on 3) is correct, does that mean a stock’s price can be (marginally) influenced by the demand on all the ETFs that contains it?

2024-07-12 17:38:08,why is buy and hold still an effective investment strategy,"In professional funds, effective trading strategies are generally kept secret to avoid them getting ""crowded out"". Each strategy tends to have a maximum amount of profit it can generate, and the more people that use the strategy, the less profit that strategy returns. Buy and hold, on the other hand, seems to have no such restriction. Even though it is one of the most well known and commonly executed investment strategies, it's still very effective. So effective, in fact, that it outperforms the majority of active investment strategies as well! So what makes ""buy and hold"" one of the most effective investment strategies, even though it's one of the most common?"
2024-07-12 22:29:19,my bull case for amzn,"Hello all, currently AMZN is a significant part of my portfolio because…

They are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won’t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.

Amazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn’t make much sense.

They are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. 

Their PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

The stock has an average rating of ""buy"" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.

Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.

Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data."

2024-07-17 09:20:50,am i missing something,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. Are there any examples of some that don’t? Thanks in advance.

2024-07-18 11:03:46,tsmc secondquarter profit beats expectations as ai chip boom continues ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the second quarter, as demand for advanced chips used in AI applications continue to surge.

Here are TSMC’s second-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), vs. NT$657.58 billion expected

Net income: NT$247.85 billion, vs. NT$238.8 billion LSEG SmartEstimate weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate

TSMC reported net revenue rose 40.1% from a year ago to NT$673.51 billion, while net income increased 36.3% from a year ago to NT$247.85 billion. The firm guided second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei in an earnings call on Thursday said business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for its industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, though it was offset by continuous smartphone seasonality.

Explosive demand for AI has stretched chip supplies. TSMC is the world’s main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, though rivals such as Samsung and Intel have been trying to challenge its dominance. It counts Apple and Nvidia among its clientele.

“I also try to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot. Today, the demand is so high I had to work very hard to meet customer demand,” Wei told analysts.

“The supply continues to be pretty tight, all the way through 2025,” Wei warned, adding that the firm hopes the tight supply can ease in 2026.

The chip giant currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips.

Development of 2-nanometer technology is “progressing well” and is on track for volume production in 2025, said TSMC. 

For the third quarter, the business is expected to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand, said Wei, adding that they continue to expect 2024 to be “a strong growth year for TSMC.”

TSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. This compares to $17.3 billion in revenue posted in the same period a year ago.

For its capital budget this year, the firm is narrowing the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, versus a previous forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion. Out of this budget, 70% to 80% will go toward advanced technologies.

“We are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support customers,” Wei said.

The firm further added that it is not ruling out the possibility of converting more “N5” technology into “N3″ technology to meet the strong demand for 3-nanometer chips.

TSMC shares closed 2.43% lower on Thursday, as Asian chip stocks tumbled on the back of a U.S. tech sell-off sparked by reports that Washington is considering tighter export curbs.

Big AI demand

Surging demand for advanced chips used in AI applications has boosted TSMC’s Taiwan-listed shares by nearly 70% so far this year.

“The demand for generative AI is surging in the cloud and at the edge. TSMC’s N3 process boasts good yield rates and well-managed production lines. The market is well-funded, and regional political factors drive increased demand for advanced processes,” Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, said on Friday ahead of the results.

Wang said the capacity of the 3-nanometer process is expected to more than double in 2024 compared to the previous year.

Needham analysts on Monday said they expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth target, reiterating a “buy” rating and raising the price target to $210 from $168 on the chip giant’s U.S.-listed shares.

“We expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth outlook from ‘low- to mid-20s’ to ‘mid- to high-20s’ but maintain its 2024 [capital expenditures] target at $30 billion on the upcoming earnings call,” Needham said in a note.

TSMC held 62% of global foundry market share in the first quarter, up from 59% in the same period a year ago, according to Counterpoint Research data.

2024-07-18 13:26:43,rddt is going to crush its next 2 earnings and you are overlooking it,"**""B-but reddit sucks and fuck spez... amirite?""** Yeah yeah yeah, it's super cool to hate on Reddit as a Redditor.

That doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.

**""But Reddit has never made a profit""** - Yes, low expectations are why this is an opportunity. As dumb as it sounds, Reddit has never *tried* to be profitable. This is changing as they are now a public company with fiduciary responsibility.

1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest. They are beginning to **finally** enable effective target marketing based on user interests, demographics, etc. **Remember, Reddit user interests and hobbies are neatly sorted into what subreddits they are subscribed to, visit, and their comment history.** I can feed an AI a Reddit user's comment history and it will create a pretty accurate profile of their interests, hobbies, age, location, and problems. **This is a medium absolutely RIPE for advertising, and Reddit's recent partnership with OpenAI WILL be leveraged for both target marketing and advertisement creation.**
2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers. 
3. **Reddit user growth 37% YoY -** Reddit's partnership with Google is serving up Reddit to normies in swathes. People who might not have been aware of it have been using it for research, opinions, hobbies, etc. Many of these people will, and are, being pulled in as full reddit users. **I caught my normie wife using reddit for her crafting hobbies and pregnancy products research. People are appending ""reddit"" to their Google searches because they crave authentic human discussion**. This is not even mentioning short term catalysts for people visiting reddit for human discussion: *2024 US presidential election and associated turmoil*
4. **Reddit user demographics -** Reddit is inherently commercial. People discuss purchases, hobbies, and interests constantly. Its users are also largely high income individuals in 1st world countries between the ages of 18 to 40. This is the most valuable demographic for advertisers, as these people actually have discretionary spending ability.
5. **Reddit's moat and competitive advantage** - Reddit's collection of communities and cultures spanning almost every interest has kept it growing steadily for over a decade. No other single platform beats it for ANY individual to find several communities that meet their interests in one place, share news, participate in authentic human discussion, and access a treasure trove of questions asked by users over the past decade. Reddit doesn't always have the best answers to questions, but its discussions are largely real people sharing honest opinions, and that has a lot of value.

-----------Long term bull cases----------

**6. AI Data Deals** - AI is getting more advanced and will rapidly continue to do so for the next decade. Reddit contains 15 years of human discussion on every topic imaginable, and it is constantly building its data for every fresh topic. This is a valuable data source for LLM training, and there could be growth in this sector. **""B-But pizza glue"" -** We are still in the early stages, and the pros will outweigh the cons long term.

**7. Reddit Marketplace** - It's only a matter of time before reddit facilitates C2B and C2C transactions for its many hobbies and interests. There is money to be made there.

8. **Meme stock potential -** Reddit has made the news countless times. For the past few years, it has become a meme stock generator attracting the attention of institutions and retail investors alike. If it starts to spike, which it will, I can see the potential for a ""meme buy-in"" of a stock like RDDT.

9. **Acquisition** - If big tech decides to acquire reddit for any number of good reasons, you win as a shareholder as they will pay a premium.

10. **International expansion and AI translation -** Reddit is investing heavily in using AI to translate all content as human readable across all languages, with the goal of connecting people internationally and expanding its audience internationally. There is a shit ton of money to be made internationally and it is only a matter of time before this occurs.

**""When is the next earnings call?""** - August 6th. I think this has the potential to crush, and the following one in early November will have even more potential.

**Similar company valuation comparison:** I believe the following valuations are FAIR for how much revenue has been reported recently, but I believe it does not account for what will be a big surge in RDDT revenue. Reddit will easily meet the valuation of Pinterest, making it 3x. Longer term, I see 8x-10x.

**RDDT - 10.6bil**

**PINTEREST - 28bil**

**SNAP - 24bil**

**""Okay what's your position then?""**

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-22 13:55:44,berkshire trims bank of america stake for the first time since 2019 ,"Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its gigantic Bank of America holding for the first time in four and a half years following the bank’s strong 2024 run.

Warren Buffett’s conglomerate sold 33.9 million shares of Bank of America shares for almost $1.5 billion in separate sales on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at an average selling price of $43.56, a regulatory filing showed.

It marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019 that the Omaha-based conglomerate has reduced the stake. Still, Bank of America remains Berkshire’s second largest equity position after Apple, holding 999 million shares with a market value of almost $43 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire is still Bank of America’s largest shareholder with a 10.8% stake.

Berkshire could be taking some profits as Bank of America has rallied 27.4% so far this year to its highest levels since March 2022. In the first quarter, Buffett trimmed Berkshire’s Apple holding by 13% for tax reasons following sizable gains.

Shares of Bank of America dipped slightly on Monday following the news.

Bathtub idea

The Oracle of Omaha’s purchase of Bank of America has become one of the most endearing Wall Street tales. In 2011, the legendary investor bought $5 billion worth of the bank’s preferred stock and warrants to shore up confidence in the lender as it grappled with losses related to subprime mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Buffett later revealed that he got the idea while taking a bath in his tub.

“Incidentally, that BofA purchase, it literally was true that I was sitting in the bathtub when I got the idea of checking with ... BofA, whether they’d be interested in that preferred,” he said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in 2017, when he first converted the warrants and added the bank stock to his portfolio.

The 93-year-old investor said he was attracted to CEO Brian Moynihan’s leadership and the profit-generating abilities of the franchise.

Moynihan later recalled that Buffett initially tried to reach him through Bank of America’s public phone line, but got rejected by the call center. Despite the snafu, the deal still came together within hours, he said.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based holding company sold another 18.9 million shares via transactions on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at an average price of $42.46, raising $802.5 million, a new regulatory filing showed.

Over the last six trading sessions, Berkshire has unloaded 52.8 million Bank of America shares worth $2.3 billion, reducing the stake to 12.5%. Berkshire still owns 980.1 million Bank of America shares with a market value of $41.3 billion, a distant second to its $172.5 billion holding in Apple.

Berkshire is required to disclose its stock moves within two business days after they are made, when the stake in any company exceeds 10%.

Buffett could be trimming the bet on valuation concerns after Charlotte-based Bank of America outperformed the broader market this year. The bank stock is up more than 25% in 2024, compared to almost 14% for the S&P 500.

It marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019 that Berkshire cut its Bank of America stake. In 2011, the Oracle of Omaha bought $5 billion worth of the bank’s preferred stock and warrants to shore up confidence in the lender as it grappled with losses related to subprime mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Just last year, Buffett spoke highly of the leadership at Bank of America, even as he offloaded other financial names. In 2022, Berkshire exited a handful of longtime bank positions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp. 

“I invited myself in, many years earlier, and they made a very decent deal for us. And I like Brian Moynihan enormously, and I just don’t want to, I don’t want to sell it,” Buffett said in 2023 of holding Bank of America.

2024-07-25 15:07:41,how innovative is big tech ,"I am curious to hear others opinions why they invest in Big Tech, is it just because it's a safe popular investment? I have traded for years now, and never put a dime in any of those companies based on personal beliefs. I would differentiate Big Tech into 'innovative' companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia etc. versus ones with very little innovation like Amazon and Meta. I feel a company like Meta is flooded with so much capital, they waste it on ridiculous projects like Metaverse and enormous salaries for useless jobs. Am I wrong? What innovation has Meta accomplished? What do they do with all their money?? Don't they just keep their social media apps running, how hard is that? When Musk fired 80% of Twitter, that somewhat reaffirmed my belief that you don't need many thousands of employees to run a website. Am I wrong?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-29 13:55:18,apple to roll out artificial intelligence features in october ,"Apple’s new artificial intelligence features will roll out in October, missing the initial launch of iPhone and iPad software updates, according to a Bloomberg report released on Monday.

The company split the Apple Intelligence features from the initial iOS launch due to concerns over their stability and need to run tests on a wider scale, the report said. 

Apple previously said its AI features would be released in a beta version this fall, and they’re expected to help drive sales of Apple’s new iPhones. The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.

Apple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.

The company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls. 

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”"

2024-08-01 18:13:46,analyzing the analysts using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the sp,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?"
2024-08-01 20:33:42,apple sales rise 5 topping estimates as ipad and services revenue jump,"Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated 

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

The numbers of the second quarter released by apple were beating expectations showing that Apple is proffitable and has their loyal consumerbase which gives the company time to actualy make something out of their AI integration without rushing random functions out. Eventhough real tech people might not be a fan of having to wait most normal people will want a smooth experience which is well integrated even if it takes longer, their userbase likes the walled garden and will not change companies quickly. The big providers have said they see that people are waiting for the iphone sixteen and I think that it will be something people get exited about it doesn’t have to be the best new ai ever for most people the bitmoji and recorded calls will be what they will use most and will be envious about. Just like with the Blue and Green bubble in messages I think these features will become a must have for many.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-08-02 14:28:23,22yo investing for roughly three years having regrets about my choices,"Hello stockers. I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

2024-08-02 14:36:29,berkshire sells 38 billion worth of bank of america in 12day selling spree ,"Warren Buffett is not done selling Bank of America.

Berkshire Hathaway shed a total of 19.2 million BofA shares on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for almost $779 million at an average selling price of $40.52 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The conglomerate has now been offloading the bank stock for 12 consecutive days with total sales now exceeding $3.8 billion. Its remaining 942.4 million shares have a market value of $37.2 billion at Thursday’s close of $39.50.

As of Thursday’s close, Bank of America fell to the No.3 spot on Berkshire’s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express, which is currently valued at $37.7 billion. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire’s second biggest holding.

Berkshire remains the bank’s largest shareholder with a 12.1% stake.

The bank stock has dropped 5.2% so far this week, going as low as $38.98 in Thursday’s trading as recession fears plague the financial sector. Year to date, BofA is up more than 17%, outperforming the S&P 500.

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA’s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis, shoring up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA, vowing that it would be a “long, long time” before he would sell.

The legendary investor said then that he liked the business, valuation and management of the Charlotte-based bank “very much.”

BofA, under the leadership of Brian Moynihan since 2010, recently reported blowout results for the second quarter that showed rising investment banking and asset management fees as well as a positive outlook on net interest income.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

2024-08-06 20:54:37,getting a gut check on intc,"YTD INTC is down about 58.5% as of last check and in the short run it's outlook looks terrible especially given the negative press with their core product desktop CPUs.

However I can't help but draw parallels to how AMD was looking about 10 years ago trading for under $2 and now for roughly $130. 

In some ways I feel Intel has a much better potential to bounce back than even AMD did. 

Chief of which being how incredibly wide their business is. 
While AMD is chiefly focused on CPUs and GPUs, Intel has both plus a much stronger presence in wireless chips, storage hardware, the USB patent and may others that AMD does / did not have. In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. 

Plus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. 

This seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And
AMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. 

However, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. 

I keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. 

Note, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. 


Edit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. 

I feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon.

2024-08-06 22:24:32,why buffet sold apple,"Just my theory, but in my opinion Buffet does not try to time the market and there isn't anything glaringly wrong with the company, and he already had a massive amount in cash, so why sell? 

Personally I think he did it for his successor. Buffet is 94, and when he passes (hopefully man years from now) all eyes will be on his successor to the changes he makes. And if that man sells Apple at some point in the future he will be greatly criztied for trimming one of Buffet's largest holdings. He is leaving him a large cash fund to be able to buy the companies he wants and not be critiqued for having to liquidate Buffet and Mungers previous picks. 

What do you think? I'd love to hear your thoughts on why he sold and why is has the largest cash position ever ?"

2024-08-07 18:13:35,warren buffett now owns more tbills than the federal reserve ,"Berkshire Hathaway now owns more in Treasury bills than the U.S. Federal Reserve as Warren Buffett builds up his cash fortress to a record level.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate held $234.6 billion in short-term investments in Treasury bills at the end of the second quarter, while it owned more than $42 billion of cash and cash equivalents that included T-bills with maturities of three months or less, according to its quarterly financial report.

That compared with $195.3 billion in T-bills that the Fed owned as of July 31. The central bank held $4.4 trillion in Treasury securities that include notes, bonds and inflation-linked securities. The Fed was a big buyer of the government’s debt during the pandemic and is always one of the largest holders of Treasurys as part of its effort to keep liquidity in the markets.

Buffett, 93, pulled off a surprising and yet prescient move by selling big chunks in stock holdings including Apple last quarter, ahead of a drastic global sell-off this week. Berkshire has been a seller of stocks for seven quarters straight, but that selling accelerated in the last period with Buffett shedding more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter.

Many loyal Buffett watchers viewed the decision to dump his top holdings as a wake-up call with the Oracle of Omaha seemingly turning bearish on the economy and the markets.

Buffett has noted in the past during times of crisis that he’ll buy Treasury bills directly at auction. The government sells T-bills for terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.

Buffett’s gigantic war chest has been earning sizeable returns thanks to the pop in Treasury yields over the past two years. If invested in 3-month Treasury bills at about 5%, $200 billion in cash would generate about $10 billion a year, or $2.5 billion a quarter.

After the Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, the central bank bought about $5 trillion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds to help aid the economy. But the Fed has been shrinking its asset holdings since June 2022, in a program widely known as quantitative tightening.

The Fed seeks to promote maximum employment and stable prices by independently setting monetary policy. It includes buying and selling Treasury securities held by the public to control the money supply and interest rates.

Apple PE is 37.74, forward PE is 31.41

Even NVIDA forward PE is 39.09 

  
Is there expectation that Costco's growth is like a tech stock moving forward? They are cracking down on membership sharing, but is that enough to offset potential lost sales vs membership revenue (those sharing buying their own like what Netflix did?)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-08-09 11:11:25,tsmc sales grow 45 in july on strong ai chip demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.

Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.

Taiwan’s biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.

TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.

Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.

Worries about the global economic outlook over the past week interrupted the AI rally that had seen key players like TSMC gains billions in market value. Investors opted to cash out of some of the year’s biggest gainers, pushing TSMC’s shares down 10% in a day, though the company recovered much of that in subsequent days as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.

2024-08-13 20:41:53,google launches first aipowered android update and new pixel 9 phones,"Google on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence features that are coming to Android devices. The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple, which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year.

Google doesn’t make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the company’s Gemini AI subscription program.

“We’ve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person,” said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. “It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.”

“Starting today, you can bring up Gemini’s overlay on top of the app you’re using to ask questions about what’s on your screen,” Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google.

Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year it’s heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices.

One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.

The assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps.

“For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainer’s email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio,” the company stated in its blog post. 

The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and “create an image of a cake for someone who loves space,” which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video.

You can ask about what’s on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said it’s working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later.

Gemini’s assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini “Live” feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. “Live” will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Google’s Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month.

In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAI’s ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images.

Apple’s system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system won’t be released until next year.

New Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3

Google also announced its latest line of homegrown “Pixel” phones, including the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which come with the Gemini AI features.

The Pixel 9 series has, among other new features, an upgraded camera and a screen that’s 35% brighter for better viewing in direct sunlight. It ships with Google’s latest Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM to support AI use. RAM stands for random access memory —an important part of a computer’s hardware that stores data needed to run applications.

RAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone. Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AI.

By contrast, only high-end iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence, which AI developers believe is due to lower amounts of memory installed on older iPhones.

The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which costs $100 more than the Pixel 8, however, smartphone costs have risen across most phone makers in the last year. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with a free year of “Gemini Advanced” subscription, starts at $999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799.

Lastly, Google also announced the Pixel Watch 3. It’s available in two sizes, 41 millimeter and 45 mm, with larger screens than earlier models. New features include the option to plan running workouts, information on your recovery with readiness and cardio load data, and AI-powered workout recommendations. Google also said the Pixel Watch 3 is more deeply embedded with its ecosystem, allowing you to access Nest camera and doorbell feeds, the Google TV remote, offline Google Maps, and more. The Pixel Watch 3 offers up to 24 hours of battery life, or up to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode.

2024-08-13 21:03:15,bloomberg us considers a rare antitrust move breaking up google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

2024-08-14 01:24:24,why was berkshire hathaway so heavy invested in apple,"Last week it was announced that BH cut 50% of their stake in Apple. Before the cut the stock represented 44% of the company's whole portfolio. To me this ratio seems incredibly excessive compared to most big holding companies. I think Apple is a good stock to own. But, why would the company put so many eggs in one basket? It doesn't seem like good risk management to me?"
2024-08-14 06:37:45,the consumer recession of 20232024 and the future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory."
2024-08-14 06:37:45,the consumer recession of 20232024 and the future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas.

2024-08-14 12:14:48,goog  bull case  custom tpu leading to successful ai products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now."

2024-08-15 23:05:45,apparently nelson peltztrian still has some or at least few disney stocks left how does this whole thing work,"Towards the end of May 2024, it was reported that Nelson Peltz sold all of his Disney stocks:

> **Nelson Peltz Reportedly Sold All of His Disney Stock, Earning $1 Billion, After Losing Proxy Fight**
> 
> Nelson Peltz cashed out his shares of Disney shortly after the activist investor lost his bid to win seats on the Mouse House’s board, according to a CNBC report Wednesday.
> 
> Peltz sold all of his Disney stock at “close to $120 dollars a share,” making about $1 billion on the sale, CNBC reported, citing an anonymous source. That would indicate that Peltz sold the shares in the days immediately after the April 3 Disney shareholder meeting — where his bid to shake up Disney’s board was soundly defeated.
> 
> A rep for Trian Partners, the hedge fund headed by Peltz, declined to comment. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
> 
> At the April 3 virtual meeting of Disney shareholders, investors voted to reelect the current 12-member board of directors by a substantial margin over the candidates nominated by Trian — Peltz himself and ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo — and a smaller investment firm, Blackwells Capital.
> 
> Peltz, in an appearance on CNBC April 4, had threatened to resume his activist agenda at Disney if the company and CEO Bob Iger did not keep their “promises.”
> 
> “I hope this is not a redo of last year where we pulled out, gave management a chance and the stock went down,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview. He added, “Whether we stay [invested in Disney] or not, we don’t make those kinds of announcements.”
> 
> Peltz’s Trian had at one time controlled 32.3 million shares of Disney, including about 30 million owned by former Marvel Entertainment head Ike Perlmutter. (Disney alleged Perlmutter harbored a longstanding personal vendetta against Iger.) At the end of 2023, Trian’s stake represented 1.8% of Disney’s outstanding shares.
> 
> In his proxy fight, one of Peltz’s biggest complaints was his allegation that Disney’s board failed to do its job with CEO succession planning in not vetting former parks boss Bob Chapek, who was Iger’s personal pick to take over the job in 2020. “They all took Bob’s word, and they voted Chapek in. That’s not what the responsibility of a director is,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview last month. The board ousted Chapek in November 2022 and brought Iger back on as CEO.
> 
> In an appearance earlier on CNBC on April 4, Iger reiterated that the Disney board’s top priority is the CEO succession and he said “they’re treating it with urgency.” He also said Disney’s long-term goal is to hit double-digit margins in the streaming business, which was another key point in Trian’s proxy campaign.

https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/nelson-peltz-sells-all-disney-stock-proxy-fight-1236019099/

...but here, he still has some of those stocks left:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/significant-shake-nelson-peltzs-portfolio-035959244.html

...although... based on this:

> The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), reduced by 29,692,273 shares, resulting in a -91.82% decrease in shares and a -45.29% impact on the portfolio. The stock traded at an average price of $107.65 during the quarter and has returned -17.67% over the past three months and -3.93% year-to-date.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/significant-shake-nelson-peltzs-portfolio-035959244.html

...it doesn't look like he bought new stocks.

What do you think might've happened? I didn't see much news about Peltz buying Disney stocks again even though someone like him buying Disney stocks again might've been on the news a lot more. And what do you think this means for Disney?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The layoffs, including roughly 600 jobs at GM’s tech campus near Detroit, come less than six months after leadership changes overseeing the operations, including former Apple executive Mike Abbott leaving the automaker due to health reasons.

“As we build GM’s future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritize the investments that will have the greatest impact,” a GM spokesman said in an emailed statement. “As a result, we’re reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organization. We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward.”

GM declined to disclose the entire number of layoffs, but a source familiar with the action confirmed more than 1,000 salaried employees would be laid off, including 600 in Warren, Michigan.

2024-08-21 00:34:56,big tech stock price vs market cap ,"So I was thinking about where big tech stock prices can go from here considering 7 stocks account for a significant portion of the US market already. It’s hard to comprehend a company that is already 7% of the total market, consistently beating the market over the long run. 

Then it hit me; With share buy backs, assuming these companies are buying back more shares than they’re paying out in comp every year (which it looks like they are), the stock prices of the major big tech companies should increase by a higher amount than their market caps do. 

A quick Google search reveals that AAPLs outstanding shares decreased 2.9% in 2022 and around similar amount in 2021. This basically a “guaranteed” 2% of annual growth on the existing shares not taking into account other factors that affect stock price?

Is there anywhere I can see a graph of a company’s market cap like you can do with stock price? I’d like to compare share price growth to market cap growth.

2024-08-25 10:08:48,ai in advertising  can it justify the cost,"Here’s a question:
Gen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.


Back then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.
Let’s talk big here - advertising.


Of course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? 


Population growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.


My question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?


In limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?


Maybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.


In any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.


What do you think?"

2024-08-26 20:46:33,apple to replace cfo luca maestri on jan 1 ,"Apple announced Monday that it will replace Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Jan. 1 with current Apple insider Kevan Parekh.

Maestri will continue to lead teams focusing on IT, security, and real estate development, Apple said. He had been Apple CFO since 2014.

Parekh, the incoming CFO, has been on Maestri’s finance leadership team for years as the company’s VP of Financial Planning and Analysis.

“For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apple’s finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple’s next CFO,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

Maestri was named Apple CFO in 2014, before the stock began a torrid run, partially powered by strong demand for iPhones. He oversaw Apple’s record-breaking capital return program, and appeared alongside Cook on quarterly earnings calls.

In 2014, Apple’s annual sales were about $183 billion. Last year, Apple reported $383 billion in revenue. Apple stock is up over 800% since Maestri became CFO.

Maestri will continue to lead teams focusing on IT, security, and real estate development, Apple said. He had been Apple CFO since 2014.

Parekh, the incoming CFO, has been on Maestri’s finance leadership team for years as the company’s VP of Financial Planning and Analysis.

“For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apple’s finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple’s next CFO,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

Maestri was named Apple CFO in 2014, before the stock began a torrid run, partially powered by strong demand for iPhones. He oversaw Apple’s record-breaking capital return program, and appeared alongside Cook on quarterly earnings calls.

In 2014, Apple’s annual sales were about $183 billion. Last year, Apple reported $383 billion in revenue. Apple stock is up over 800% since Maestri became CFO.

2024-08-27 11:12:08,tesla investor ross gerber says hes been dumping the stock because no one wants the companys cars or robots,"* Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

2024-08-28 13:58:06,buffetts berkshire hathaway hits 1 trillion market value ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first non-technology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have rallied more than 27% in 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500′s return. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ turns 94 years old.

The shares were up 1.2% on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)

Buffett took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode as of late, dumping a massive amount of stock, including half of his Apple stake, while raising Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $277 billion at the end of June.

While Buffett famously never times the market and advises others to not try to either, these recent moves served as a wake-up call to some of his followers on Wall Street, who believe he saw some things he did not like about the economy and market valuation.

Berkshire invests the majority of its cash in short-term Treasury bills, and its holding in such securities — valued at $234.6 billion at the end of the second quarter — has exceeded the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve owns.

High price tag

Berkshire’s original Class A shares carry one of the highest price tags on Wall Street. Today, each one sells for 68% more than the median price of a home in the U.S. 

That’s because Buffett has never split the stock, arguing that the high share price attracts and retains more long-term, quality-oriented investors. The Ben Graham protégé has said that many Berkshire shareholders use their stock as a savings account.

Still, Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one thirtieth of a Class A share to cater to smaller investors wanting a small piece of the Buffett’s performance.

IBKR has much lower fees but can't do it in a TFSA. maybe that's still the better option or there's better options than IBKR?


edit: an example for clarity is LVMHF. in questrade they have its pink sheet or something. it doesn't include the dividends. to get the normal version with the dividends you have to order it over the phone lol with those lame requirements i said.


Edit 2: in questrade you can split up the minimum $5000 USD between multiple securities. And hopefully people stop thinking I’m asking about withholding tax lmao I appreciate it though but I’m looking for a brokerage or something that will let me buy the normal version of a stock like LVMHF including its dividends without fees and requirements as bad as questrade’s"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* Brokerages selling my order flow.
* Brokerages ""shutting down"" a stock while it's meme peaking (I don't put serious money into meme stocks).
* A brokerage has on-the-phone customer service.

(I realize other people care about these factors, and I'm not saying they are unimportant in general. They are just unimportant for me atm.)

These factors aside, what am I giving up going with Robinhood vs Fidelity (which seems to be a very well-liked brokerage)?"
2024-09-04 13:00:41,reuters exclusive intel manufacturing business suffers setback as broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-06 00:40:52,broadcom says it will sell 12 billion in ai parts and custom chips this year,"Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.

Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.

Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:

Earnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected

Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected

Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.

Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.

The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.

Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google’s TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.

“Broadcom’s third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,” Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company’s VMware acquisition.

2024-09-06 09:30:09,rstocks daily discussion  fundamentals friday sep 06 2024,"This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Other websites offer option chain lists data but their data is delayed by 15 minutes and some dont list contract price changes in percentage but rather just give it dollar amount...and some websites require you to pay to access   
  
Some websites require you to register which is something i dont mind doing unless they ask for my social security number (SIN) and phone number ... cause you know its all going to get leaked / hacked one day :-(

so are there any websites that will just give the options chain data, with percent change, without delay and free of charge?"
2024-09-06 14:53:04,bloomberg tsmcs arizona trials put plant productivity on par with taiwan,"> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. achieved production yields at its Arizona facility on par with established plants back home, an early indicator that its marquee US project is on track to achieve its targets.

> The Taiwanese chipmaker’s yield rate in trial production at its first advanced US plant is similar to comparable facilities in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan, according to a person familiar with the company, who asked not to be identified discussing private corporate matters. TSMC had said it started engineering wafer production in April with advanced 4-nanometer process technology.

> Yield rate, or how many usable chips a company can produce during a single manufacturing process, is a key factor that impacts profitability. While TSMC doesn’t disclose its yield rate, investors are counting on the company’s ability to maintain steady margins. The company has said it can maintain gross margin rates at 53% or higher in the long run, and has kept its net profit steady at above 36% over the past four years.

> TSMC said in an email that its Arizona project is “proceeding as planned with good progression,” without commenting on the yield.

> The go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. originally planned to have its first Arizona plant start full production in 2024, but pushed back the target to 2025 due to a lack of skilled workers. The delay fueled concerns that the company might not be able to make chips in the US as efficiently as in Taiwan.

> The US plans to award TSMC $6.6 billion in grants and as much as $5 billion in loans to support the chipmaker’s $65 billion in investments at three plants in Arizona.

2024-09-08 21:02:32,the aapl monday morning arbitrage trade codename 7senshinos arbitrage,"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

2024-09-09 23:47:01,goldman sachs to post 400 million hit to third quarter on consumer unwind ,"Goldman Sachs will post a roughly $400 million pretax hit to third-quarter results as the bank continues to unwind its ill-fated consumer business.

CEO David Solomon said Monday at a conference that by unloading Goldman’s GM Card business, as well as a separate portfolio of loans, the bank would post a hit to revenues when it reports results next month.

It is the latest turbulence related to Solomon’s push into consumer retail. In late 2022, Goldman began to pivot away from its nascent consumer operations, beginning a series of write-downs related to selling chunks of the business. Goldman’s credit card business, in particular its Apple Card, allowed rapid growth in retail lending, but also led to losses and friction with regulators.

Goldman is instead focusing on asset and wealth management to help drive growth. The bank was in talks to sell the GM Card platform to Barclays, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.

Solomon also said Monday that trading revenue for the quarter was headed for a 10% decline because of a tough year-over-year comparison and difficult trading conditions in August for fixed-income markets.

2024-09-10 08:14:19,apple loses eu court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

2024-09-10 22:33:30,amazon passed google as 4th largest in sp 500,"“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

2024-09-11 15:28:57,berkshire unloads another chunk of bank of america as ceo lauds buffett ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded another chunk of Bank of America shares, bringing its total sales to more than $7 billion since mid-July and reducing its stake to 11%.

The Omaha-based conglomerate shed a total of 5.8 million BofA shares in separate sales on Friday, Monday and Tuesday for almost $228.7 million at an average selling price of $39.45 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The latest action extended Berkshire’s selling streak to 12 consecutive sessions, matching the 12 consecutive sessions from July 17 to Aug. 1.

Berkshire has sold more than 174.7 million shares of the Charlotte-based bank for $7.2 billion, with 858.2 million shares remaining, or 11.1% of shares outstanding. BofA has fallen to the No.3 spot on Berkshire’s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire’s second biggest holding.

Moynihan on Buffett

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA’s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The “Oracle of Omaha” then added 300 million more shares to his bet around 2018 and 2019.

BofA CEO Brian Moynihan made a rare comment about Berkshire’s sales Tuesday, saying he has no knowledge of Buffett’s motivation for selling.

“I don’t know what exactly he’s doing, because frankly, we can’t ask him. We wouldn’t ask,” he said during Barclays Global Financial Services Conference, according to a transcript on FactSet. “But on the other hand, the market’s absorbing the stock .... we’re buying a portion of the stock, and so life will go on.”

Shares of BofA have dipped just about 1% since the start of July, and the stock is up 16.7% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500.

Moynihan, who has been leading the bank since 2010, praised the 94-year-old’s shrewd investment in his bank in 2011, which helped shore up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages.

“He’s been a great investor for our company, and stabilized our company when we needed at the time,” he said.

To illustrate how lucrative Buffett’s investment has been, Moynihan said if investors were to buy his bank stock the same day Buffett did, they would have been able to capture the low price of $5.50 per share. The stock last traded just under $40 apiece.

“He just had the guts to do it in a big way. And he did it. And it’s been a fabulous return for him. We’re happy that he gets it,” Moynihan said.

I wanted to be updated when a new press release came out so I wrote a script that did just that. The project got a bit out of hand and I ended up creating a Script that works universally with any given press release site and sends a notification to a webhook when something new comes up. By using a webhook app you can therefore get notifcations right to your phone. I uploaded the script to github I hope you like it and it helps some of you with your analysis/tracking:

2024-09-12 20:02:23,google is down almost 20 percent from ath and has entered bear market territory my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. 
Id also like to add an investment piece they have “We have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.”

They have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.

All of this can be found on their earnings report: https://investors.klaviyo.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-09-13 19:56:47,if your the type of investor who mainly invests in companies that benefits your life do you invest in rddt,"For example my cousin is a big Apple person (Iphone, Apple Watch, Apple TV etc) and is a shopaholic at Ulta. So she purchases stocks of these companies.  She says she doesn't care about the stock performance that much - as these companies provide her with value and satisfaction in her life. 

In a way, like trying to recover the cost for the several Iphones she has bought since the start. 

But when I asked her about Reddit... something she uses, she is iffy about purchasing the stock.  Her reasoning is, its offerings is not tangible.. so she is not sure how the company really makes money.  Even with ads propping up, she isn't sold ... for now.

I personally have bought some RDDT stocks because I use it often and feel like I owe it back if that makes sense.

Ok question for those that have the mindset more like my cousin or in general don't see a pathway to solid profitability.

>Scenerio: If RDDT couldn't continue to operate due to lack of ads profit and mediocre stock performance. Would you buy some of its stocks... help raise capital and keep it above water?

I don't believe it will happen, but man it be a bummer if it ever went under.

It seems like they're hard to find, if they even exist at all. No matter what sector, there's some form of criticism that goes against them...

* Communication Services: Oligopolies (internet service companies), data privacy issues (GOOG, META)
* Consumer Discretionary: Anti-union practices and exploitation (AMZN, NKE)
* Consumer Staples: Anti-union practices and exploitation (WMT, TGT), environmental and health concerns (KO, MO)
* Energy: Environmental and health concerns (oil/gas companies)
* Financials: Reckless banking practices (pretty much any bank)
* Health Care: Price gouging (drug companies, health insurance companies)
* Industrials: Endangerment (weapons companies), environmental and health concerns (transportation companies)
* Information Technology: Monopoly attempts and data privacy concerns (AAPL, MSFT)
* Materials: Environmental and health concerns (any chemicals company)

2024-09-15 16:48:52,apple the new healthtech giant,"
This week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.

Yet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.

Does anyone see what I am seeing, or am I missing something here?

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, September 16th, 2024! :)**"
2024-09-16 17:25:25,fda clears apples sleep apnea detection feature for use heres how it works,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared Apple
’s new sleep apnea detection feature for use, which means it will come to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 later this month. 

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person’s breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. 

“We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea,” Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the feature’s launch video.

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature marks the company’s latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. 

To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where they’re monitored overnight. Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. 

At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple’s newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399. 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature is “potentially a game changer” for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.  

Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they’re showing signs of sleep apnea.  

Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple’s sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their healthcare providers to get an official diagnosis. 

“People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,” Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview. 

Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for U.S. the health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.

“By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.”

How it works 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls “breathing disturbances.” The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns. 

Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they’ll be classified as either “elevated” or “not elevated,” i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show “consistent signs” of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.

Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months’ worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well. 

Apple said the notification algorithm was developed with “an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,” and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.

“Now I’m jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,” Kuhlmann said.

2024-09-16 20:18:25,intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary allow outside funding,"Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

2024-09-18 14:50:30,google wins court challenge to the eus 17 billion antitrust fine over ad product ,"The European Union’s second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.

The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.

Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.

But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.

The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU’s General Court.

The General Court said Wednesday that it “upholds the majority of the findings” but “annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of” nearly 1.5 billion euros.

The court added that the commission “failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses” that it had deemed abusive.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.

“This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission’s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.

The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.

This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

","I was looking at the balance sheet of apple in a video I was watching and it showed that apples equity has been going down a lot from 2017 to 2021 .When they looked closer at the equity statements they concluded that it was because they were doing large share buybacks, so cash was used to buy the stock ie assets were reduced as cash is an asset.

However even though cash was used to buyback stocks , the stock in itself is also an asset and the price of apple stock has only gone up from 2017 to 2021 so this should more than counteract the effect of assets reduction due to cash being used to buy back shares and thus equity really shouldn't have changed significantly because of that ."
2024-09-25 19:42:22,meta unveils 299 quest 3s vr headset orion ar glasses prototype ,"Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

2024-09-27 01:17:32,rivian stock  buy  ,"Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!"

2024-10-01 00:30:05,this quick look at baba pricefcf says its a screaming buy,"I do not hold a position. But maybe I should. 

Baba is @ $254B market cap. In 2023 they reported a FCF of $21B. That's a 12 price/FCF ratio.

Aapl for some context trades @ $3.54T market cap. In 2023 they reported a FCF of $99.5B. That's a 34.3 price/FCF ratio.

I know it's a chinese stock and they should be ""discounted"" because of American's perceived risk but this seems a bit excessive of a discount. Even when it was trading at ATH's it had a price/FCF of 4.5 which to me still seems like a screaming buy. Given the recent china stimulus and runup of baba, I think it should still be a buy right as chinese consumers get this stimulus and baba should benefit? Am I wrong here? Are there risks I'm ignoring?"

2024-10-01 15:23:05,the crash of the stock market has arrived priceearnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire sp 500 ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|

|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|

|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

2024-10-01 15:23:05,the crash of the stock market has arrived priceearnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire sp 500 ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon.

2024-10-01 19:15:40,challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of peter lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-10-04 21:22:49,which stock is hidding in plain sight,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership. What are your hidden gems?"
2024-10-08 19:11:55,smaller companies with long term potential,"This is a continuation of a post last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller\_companies\_with\_long\_term\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller_companies_with_long_term_potential/)

If you read the comments you will notice a lot of the companies mentioned performed exceptionally well for the most part. Figured it would be good to continue this tradition as we approach 2025.

From the post:  
""This is Stocks, would like to see discussion outside of tech and ETFs. I'd like to try to identify smaller companies with long term potential, there's a few which am considering investing for next decade.

I'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.

Rational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap. There's also too much concentration in these massive behemoths which makes me rather want to invest in ETFs like QQQ and then have few moonshots on the side such as listed. What companies do you have in mind? Thoughts?"""
2024-10-09 09:32:24,tsmcs revenue for september surged 396 yoy,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) revenue for September surged 39.6% year-over-year to about NT$251.87B amid growing demand for artificial intelligence chips for use in AI products.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17."
2024-10-09 23:41:03,tsmc earnings ahead could this cause nvda to reach new highs,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

All full-time and not full-time investors here.

I’ve been investing the last few years (not full time as I have a business) & I’m trying to figure out a good stack/ way to get updated and quality data/information, to make my stock investment decisions. (Buy /hold/sell)…. like for example, institutional and professional traders use a Bloomberg terminal or the Reuters terminal.

There are so many paid unpaid blogs, and people randomly talking about stuff on forums/ Subs. 

Would love to hear how folks are managing this?

2024-10-14 20:19:59,nvidia closes at record as ai chipmakers market cap tops 34 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

2024-10-16 11:27:58,are lithium battery stocks a good buy,"Lithium batteries are used in the majority of devices we use every day; Laptops, Electric toothbrushes, E bikes, Electric tools, iPhones, vapes etc. they’re even used by manufacturing businesses within their heavy machinery and vehicles - FLASH BATTERY, these batteries are the most popular in Italy specifically and require 0 maintenance while also charging very quick compared to others available.

More importantly, with the ongoing climate crisis, governments of more economically developed countries are pushing their citizens to ‘go green’, promoting electric vehicles, bikes and even solar panels (solar panels can use lithium batteries to store extra energy). 

I am also aware however that sodium ions are a direct substitute to lithium, charging Even quicker and have an even greater life cycle. We seem to just be getting started with sodium ion batteries as the raw material supply chain isn’t very well developed.

2024-10-18 14:59:12,i flipped my entire portfolio of etfs for ai stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?"

2024-10-26 11:55:44,whats the stock youll never sell,"Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

How about you? What’s the stock you think you’ll never sell?"

All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies."
2024-10-29 18:11:02,apple announces new and smaller mac mini with first redesign since 2010,"Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  "

2024-10-31 00:40:47,dropbox  the outsider with a sticky product,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.

It had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.

The freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).



**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**

A crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**

***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***

Cloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.

Moreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.

***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***

For many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.



**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**

It is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.

You’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.

However, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**

Don’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.

The competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***



**4.0 The past acquisitions**

The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:

* **July 2012, TapEngage** \- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*
* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*
* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \- *a company allowing users to ""aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*
* **July 2013, Endorse** \- *a mobile coupon startup.*
* **April 2014, Loom** \- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*
* **April 2014, Hackpad** \- *a document-sharing startup*
* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*
* **January 2015, CloudOn** \- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*
* **January 2019, HelloSign** \- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***
* **March 2021, DocSend** \- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*
* **October 2021, Command E** \- universal search company
* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*
* **December 2022, FormSwift** \- *form management platform*



There have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.



**5.0 The financials**

If you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

The revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.

The operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).

A lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.

From 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.

So, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \~20% since becoming a public company.

Based on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.

  
**6.0 The valuation**

How does one value a company of this kind?

It has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.

Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**

Inputs:

Free cash flow - SBC of $450m.

Growth in perpetuity of 4%.

Discount rate of 8%.

Adjusting for cash/debt

The value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.

  
**7.0 My thoughts**

A company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \~8% long-term yield seems fair.

I don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.

The only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts."
2024-10-31 17:13:27,alphabet deserves a better valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-11-01 13:09:52,blackrock launches etf that expands beyond the magnificent seven,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/megacap-tech-gets-new-blackrock-etf.html


> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”"

2024-11-02 18:20:38,globalstar and apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

2024-11-03 17:27:55,healthcare company with a moat ,"Hey all,

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

If you yourself know of companies within the healthcare sector who has a moat I'd love to hear it. Or if there's any healthcare company you have in your portfolio let me know. I'll be doing my own valuation & analysis but suggestions are more than welcomed."
2024-11-04 15:06:26,nvidia overtakes apple to become worlds largest company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was off 0.6% and Broadcom rose 1.7%.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"
2024-11-06 23:27:53,qualcomm pops on chipmakers earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-11-11 15:53:47,us tech stocks will push back against eu pressure as trump signals tariffs and america first policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

2024-11-11 19:21:20,nvda has become the largest position in retail portfolios in the first half of the year,"Data on the 15 most widely held stocks and ETFs in retail portfolios and sorted by weight, NVDA tops the list with a 9.3% weighting over other popular stocks. Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate"

2024-11-13 10:53:33,supermicro  hold or sell  my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

Here a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot."
